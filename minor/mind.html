            <h2>Body Scan</h2>
            <p>Find a quiet place and sit or lie down comfortably. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Slowly scan your body from head to toe, paying attention to any sensations or tension. If you find any areas of tension, gently focus your breath on those areas and try to release the tension.</p>

            <h2>Mindful Breathing</h2>
            <p>Sit comfortably and close your eyes. Focus your attention on your breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils or the rise and fall of your chest or belly. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to your breath.</p>

            <h2>5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique</h2>
            <p>Take a moment to ground yourself in the present by using your senses. Identify and name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This exercise helps you connect with your surroundings and brings your focus to the present moment.</p>

            <h2>Mindful Walking</h2>
            <p>Take a walk outside, paying full attention to the experience. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the rhythm of your steps, and the sights, sounds, and smells around you. Try to stay present and fully engaged in each step, allowing yourself to experience the walk as a form of mindfulness.</p>

            <h2>Loving-Kindness Meditation</h2>
            <p>Sit comfortably and close your eyes. Begin by focusing on yourself and silently repeat phrases such as “May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be safe. May I live with ease.” After a few minutes, extend these wishes to others, such as loved ones, acquaintances, and even people you find challenging. This practice helps cultivate compassion and kindness.</p>
